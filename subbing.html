      <h3>Here are some tips to help you succeed and make the most of your substitute SNA role:</h3>
      <section class="link-double-list">
        <div class="link-left-list">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Be Prepared:</strong> Familiarise yourself with the school&#39;s policies, procedures, and
              expectations for substitute SNAs. Be ready to adapt quickly to different classroom
              environments and student needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate with Regular SNAs:</strong> If possible, communicate with the regular SNAs or
              special education teachers in the school before starting your subbing assignment.
              They can provide valuable insights into the students&#39; individual needs, routines, and
              any specific strategies that work well with them.</li>
            <li><strong>Observe and Ask Questions:</strong> Take time to observe the students and their
              interactions with the regular SNAs. Ask questions to better understand the students&#39;
              specific disabilities, strengths, and challenges.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Flexible and Patient:</strong> As a substitute SNA, you may be assigned to work with
              different students in various classrooms. Be flexible and patient, as each student and
              classroom dynamic may require different approaches.</li>
            <li><strong>Build Positive Relationships:</strong> Establish positive and respectful relationships with the
              students, teachers, and other school staff. A supportive and compassionate
              approach can create a welcoming learning environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Proactive:</strong> Take the initiative to engage with students and assist them in their
              learning activities. Be proactive in identifying and addressing any challenges they
              may face.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="link-right-list">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Positive Reinforcement:</strong> Praise and positive reinforcement can go a long way in
              motivating and encouraging students with additional needs. Recognise their efforts
              and achievements, no matter how small.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain Confidentiality:</strong> Respect the privacy of students and their families by
              maintaining confidentiality regarding their personal information and specific needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Seek Feedback:</strong> After each subbing assignment, seek feedback from the regular SNA,
              teachers, or school administrators. This can help you identify areas of improvement
              and enhance your performance as a substitute SNA.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuously Learn and Improve:</strong> Stay updated on best practices in special
              education and be open to learning new strategies and techniques. Attend relevant
              workshops, training sessions, or professional development opportunities to enhance
              your skills as an SNA.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep a Positive Attitude:</strong> Subbing can present various challenges, but maintaining a
              positive attitude can make a significant difference in your interactions with students
              and your overall experience as a substitute SNA.</li>

      <h2 class="italic" id="objectives">Practical steps you need to take into consideration are as follows:</h2>
    </section>
      <section class="single-ul">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wear comfy footwear &amp; clothing</strong>  – Trust me the last thing you need is to run around
            the school is 4inch heels.</li>
          <li><strong>Depending on each school</strong> (I presume the majority, I could be wrong) don’t have a
            hot food canteen, so bring snacks, lunch, and drinks with you.</li>
          <li><strong>Minimise or take off jewellery</strong> – I’ve heard some awful stories in the past where
            jewellery gets caught and the person ends up in hospital with deep cuts.</li>
          <li><strong>Bring a journal for note taking.</strong> </li>
          <li><strong>SNAs appointed on or after the 1st of January 2011 are paid an hourly rate of €15.23</strong> –
            Take note of this so when you receive your payslip you can make sure you are
            receiving the correct amount. Below is a chart on the rates of pay for an SNA.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="link-main">
      <p>
        Remember, every subbing opportunity is a chance to make a positive impact on the lives of
        students with additional needs. By being well-prepared, adaptable, and compassionate, you
        can contribute to their learning and development while gaining valuable experience in the
        field of special education &amp; inclusion.
